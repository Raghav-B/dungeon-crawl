# dungeon_crawl
## Runner up in the IEEE Hackathon 2019
Will eventually develop this further beyond what was coded during the hackathon.

Dungeon crawl capitalizes on the deep seated desire for instant gratification that youth have by gamifying quizzes and homework in the form of an RPG game. It randomizes the placment of quizzes/levels and enemy encounters during every run of the game - keeping the game fresh and allowing it to have increased longevity and replayability. Can be developed further into something akin to an MMORPG where players can compete with each other's scores by solving harder quizzes and completing all tasks assigned by a teacher.

## Features
- Random level generated from quizzes input by teachers. This keeps the game interesting as every playthrough will be different.
